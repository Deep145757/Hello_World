# Problem Statement
Develop an AI/ML-driven system for granular monitoring, logging and analysis of the existing auto-routing system to identify and analyse pattern of \n1) grievances being routed to incorrect agency/official \n2) Keep in mind that habitual complainants person/agency may file multiple grievances per Ministry and they not be made part of ranking and \n3) grievance redressal performance of various Ministries/Departments/States/UTs so as to generate ranking of their effectiveness and efficiency. \nThe proposed solution may be in the form of a dashboard, accessible via web and mobile for DARPG and other relevant officials, to monitor performance of the grievance redressal system and various registered government agencies. GRAI Report will be shared with all participants for understanding the existing ranking system.
